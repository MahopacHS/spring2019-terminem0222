These files contain raw email data, and in that data is a SPAM confidence number for each message:\n\n`X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475`\n\nOur goal will be to find each of these lines in the file, and extract the confidence number (In this case `0.8475`), with the end-goal of calculating the average SPAM Confidence of all the emails in the file. \n\n### Reading from the file\n\nLet's start with some code to read the lines of text from `ICCL-mbox-tiny.txt`"

We do this by including an `if` statement inside  the `for` loop.\n\nYou need to edit line 4 of the code below to only print lines which begin with `X-DSPAM-Confidence:` There should be **5**"
