But how do you know if a given number is valid? And how do you know which network issued the card?\n\n**Example:** Is `5300023581452982` a valid credit card number?Is it? Visa? MasterCard, Discover? or American Express?\n\nWhile eventually the card number is validated when you attempt to post a transaction, there's a lot of reasons why you might want to know its valid before the transaction takes place. The most common being just trying to catch an honest key-entry mistake made by your site visitor.\n\nSo there are two things we'd like to figure out, for any \"potential\" card number:\n\n- Who is the issuing network? Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express.\n- In the number potentially valid (as opposed to a made up series of digits)?\n\n### What does the have to do with functions?\n\nIf we get this code to work, it seems like it might be useful to re-use it in several other programs we may write in the future. We can do this by writing the code as a **function**. Think of a function as an independent program its own inputs and output. The program is defined under a name so that we can use it simply by calling its name. \n\n**Example:** `n = int(\"50\")` the function `int()` takes the string `\"50\"` as input and converts it to an `int` value `50` which is then stored in the value `n`.\n\nWhen you create these credit card functions, we might want to re-use them by placing them in a **Module** which is a file with a collection of functions in it. Furthermore we can take a group of related modules and place them together in a Python **Package**. You install packages on your computer with the `pip` command. \n"

In this approach you write the ENTIRE PROGRAM and then REWRITE IT to use functions. Yes, it's inefficient, but until you get comfotable thinking \"functions first\" its the best way to modularize your code with functions. Here's the approach:\n\n1. Write the code\n2. Refactor (change the code around) to use a function\n3. Test the function by calling it\n4. Rewrite the original code to use the new function.\n\n\nWe already did step 1: Write so let's move on to:\n\n### Step 2: refactor\n\nLet's strip the logic out of the above code to accomplish the task of the function:\n\n- Send into the function as input a credit card number as a `str`\n- Return back from the function as output the issuer of the card as a `str`\n\nTo help you out we've written the function stub for you all you need to do is write the function body code."

Write at least to tests like these ones:\n\n```\nWHEN card='5443713204330437' We EXPECT checkLuhn(card) to return True\nWHEN card='5111111111111111' We EXPECT checkLuhn(card) to return False \n```\n"
