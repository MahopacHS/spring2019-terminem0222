This process will repeat until you enter quit as which point the program will exit.\n\nWow. Seems complicated! We'll use technique called problem simplification to make this problem a little easier to solve.\n\nFirst we'll write a complete program to solve *part* of the problem, then we will take our new level of understanding to solve the *entire* problem.\n\n## Start with Sub-Problem 1\n\nLet's write a program to simply input a number and then uses a loop to print out the multiplication table up to 10  for that number. \n\nFor example, when you input `5`:\n\n```\nEnter number to multiply by: 5\n1 x 5 = 5\n2 x 5 = 10\n3 x 5 = 15\n4 x 5 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n6 x 5 = 30\n7 x 5 = 35\n8 x 5 = 40\n9 x 5 = 45\n10 x 5 = 50\n```\n"
